The Comprehensive study of socio-economic factors, migration patterns and business sustainability of street vendors of Mumbai city.
After conducting extensive literature review of multiple research papers and journal publications, we found that there is need to study the following objectives:-
1.	To study the influence of socio-economic factors on average monthly income of street vendors.
2.	To study the migration patterns among street vendors based on socio-economic factors and employment characteristics.
3.  To model daily customer count based on influential vendor characteristics.

We conducted pilot survey and modified the questionnaire.

Sampling Design:

We have used Multi-stage Stratified sampling design and divided Mumbai into 4 stratas. In the first stage, We have divided Mumbai based on the railway network : Central Line, Western Line, Harbour Line, and Trans Harbour Line. Within each railway line, we have selected six stations as the 2nd stage. The 3rd stage divides each station of the 2nd stage into East and West regions. The 4th stage categorizes street vendors based on their type of business: Food, Clothing, Mobile accessories, and Other vendors.
Conclusions are as follows:
1) Built a linear regression model in R, using stepwise selection to identify significant predictors affecting average monthly income;  found 43% of income variance explained, with higher earnings on the Western line and lower for non-food vendors.
2) Applied K-Modes clustering in Python to detect migration patterns based on socio-economic and employment traits, revealing 3 distinct vendor profiles, visualized through a dendrogram based on Hamming distance.
3) Work duration and food product type are the strongest factor affecting customer count.

Suggestions and Impact of this project:

These  findings are highly valuable for evidence-based urban planning, particularly for designing targeted interventions under the Smart Cities Mission and PM SVANidhi scheme. These insights can help urban local bodies allocate resources, define vending zones, and deliver benefits more efficiently to the most vulnerable vendor segments.
